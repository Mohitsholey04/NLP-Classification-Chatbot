# NLP Classification Chatbot
## Introduction

This Jupyter Notebook serves as the implementation and documentation for an NLP Classification Chatbot project. The goal of this project is to create an intelligent conversational agent capable of categorizing user input into predefined categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Project Outline

1. **Importing Necessary Libraries:**
   - Utilize libraries such as `nltk`, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn` for NLP, data manipulation, and machine learning.

2. **Download NLTK Resources:**
   - Ensure access to NLTK resources by downloading necessary datasets.

3. **Load and Preprocess Data:**
   - Load the dataset (replace 'your_dataset.csv' with the actual file name).
   - Preprocess text data by applying tokenization, stemming, and other relevant techniques.

4. **Train-Test Split:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

5. **Text Vectorization:**
   - Use Count Vectorization to convert text data into numerical format suitable for machine learning models.

6. **Train a Classification Model:**
   - Utilize a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for text classification.

7. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the performance of the trained model using accuracy metrics.

8. **Chatbot Function:**
   - Implement a chatbot function that takes user input, preprocesses it, and predicts the category using the trained model.

9. **Example Usage:**
   - Provide an example of interacting with the chatbot using user input.
